    <div class="my-3 fs-5">
      The Association of Computing Machinery is an international organization
      for advancing technology fields. Here at Ohio University, our local
      chapter is designed to help advance
      <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/mission-vision-values-goals"
        >ACM's Mission</a

      and help students grow. We are a group of students who are passionate
      about technology and helping each other learn more than what is taught in
      classes.

      OU ACM hosts a variety of events each semester. We have weekly meetings

      workshops, and social events. In addition, our members are encouraged to
      participate in various additional activities such as hackathons,
      cybersecurity Capture The Flag (CTF) events, and programming competitions.

          "The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic
          programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing
          their university, work to solve the most real-world problems,
          fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to
          perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams
          challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply,
          it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in
          the world." -
